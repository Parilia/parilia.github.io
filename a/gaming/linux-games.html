    <h2>Great Linux Games</h2>
    <p>
      There are many great native Linux games which I feel get overlooked since proton became a staple in the Linux
      gaming scene. There are also some very big names that run natively on Linux such as Minecraft. Below you will find
      some of my favourite native Linux games. I feel I should also mention many games have Linux versions but if they
      don't work well or as well as they would otherwise on windows I will not be including them. I will also only be
      including games I have personally played.

    <h3>Avorion</h3>
    <p>
      Avorion is a space based adventure game where you can craft your own ship and even your own fleet. To me it feels
      like a spiritual successor to freelancer. Building in the game gives you a lot of freedom and also thankfully has
      a steam workshop where you can painlessly grab ships and stations. My current play through I am going for a halo
      theme and I rather suck at the building so thankfully the workshop is there.<br>
      <br> Multiplayer, PVE, PVP, CO-OP<br>

    <h3>Vintage Story</h3>
    <p>
      Vintage Story is wilderness survival crafting game, it feels like more of a challenge than your standard survival
      game. Crops grow slowly, trees grow slow and seasons are a big deal. You can definitely see that the game started
      its life as Minecraft mod but unlike Minecraft this game is not as forgiving. If you want a challenge and are a
      fan of open world crafting survival games then you will want to have a look at this one. <br>
      <br>Multiplayer, PVE, PVP, CO-OP<br>

    <h3>Veloren</h3>
    <p>
      Veloren is an open world voxel based rpg written in rust. It is a fully open source game where assets such as
      music and graphics have been fully made by the community. It has been inspired by games such as Minecraft, breath
      of the wild and dwarf fortress. Personally I feel exploring this game world to be a fun and freeing experience and
      do highly recommend you give this game a try.<br>
      <br>Multiplayer, PVE, CO-OP<br>

    <h3>Factorio</h3>
    <p>
      Factorio is a factory building game, to me it feels the OG factory game, mining resources, researching
      technologies, building infrastructure, automating production, and fighting enemies. <br>
      <br>PVE, CO-OP<br>

    <h3>Stellaris</h3>
    <p>
      Stellaris is a space grand strategy game, it gives you so much freedom to make whatever race and empire you wish.
      From a peace loving corpo who's only goal is to make all the money to a species hell bent on the destruction of
      all
      sentient life, the choices are truly endless. "Discover a spectacular and ever-changing universe! Explore,
      discover and interact with a multitude of species as you journey among the stars. Forge a galactic empire as you
      delve into newly discovered planets, unearth treasures and establish a direction for your society. Uncover a grand
      strategy game that reaches the very edges of the universe."<br>
      <br>Multiplayer, PVE, PVP, CO-OP<br>
