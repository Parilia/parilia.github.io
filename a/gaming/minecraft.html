    <h2>Comprehensive guide to Minecraft</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to my comprehensive guide to Minecraft, here we will look at the launchers you can use, useful information
      and the best ways to install mods and datapacks.
    </p>
    <h4>Launchers</h4>
    <h3>Official Launcher</h3>
    <p>
      It goes without really saying that the easiest way to play the game is with the official launcher, it works on all
      platforms and if you can live without the quality of life features that other launchers bring then even simple
      modding is easy enough.<br>
      <br><a href="https://www.minecraft.net">https://www.minecraft.net</a>
    </p>
    <h3>Prism</h3>
    <p>
      The Prism launcher is a fork of the much loved MultiMC, it builds on it to bring a much more polished application.
      It is available on all platforms. "An Open Source Minecraft launcher with the ability to manage multiple
      instances, accounts and mods. Focused on user freedom and free redistributability."-Prism website<br>
      <br><a href="https://prismlauncher.org">https://prismlauncher.org</a>
    </p>
    <h3>Modrinth App</h3>
    <p>
      As of writing this the Modrinth app has just entered open beta and is still early in its development. In my
      opinion its looking good and has many of the feature that I have came to expect in a Minecraft launcher. It also
      has the Modrinth website integrated into the app for easy downloading of mods, modpacks, datapacks, shaders and
      resource packs.<br>

    </p>
    <h4>Mod Websites</h4>
    <h3>Modrinth</h3>
    <p>
      Modrinth is a free and open source modding platform, it is the second largest modding platform for minecraft and
      because it treats its users and modders with respect, its growing everyday. In my opinion it is a much better
      place to get your mods than the next entry on the list and way more trustworthy. "Modrinth's open-source API lets
      launchers add deep integration with Modrinth. You can use Modrinth through their our own app and some of the most
      popular launchers like ATLauncher, MultiMC, and Prism Launcher." -Modrinth<br>
      <br><a href="https://modrinth.com">https://modrinth.com</a>
    </p>
    <h3>Curse</h3>
    <p>
      Curse is not the beacon of good that it once was for the Minecraft modding scene. To me its a necessary evil as
      there are a hell of a lot of mods still exclusively on it, though that said due to decisions curse have made in
      the past they have lost some rather large mods to Modrinth. So with that said its still a place you can get mods
      and will probably have too if you are using forge. In my opinion use Modrinth as much as possible and only use
      curse if there is no other option.<br>

    <h3>Feed the Beast</h3>
    <p>
      FTB is a is a maker of modpacks, usually of a rather high quality. They have a wide selection of packs from really
      simple vanilla plus to adventure and challenging packs.<br>

    </p>
    <h4>Modding</h4>
    <h3>Modpacks</h3>
    <p>
      Downloading and installing a pre-existing modpack is the easiest way to to enjoy a large amount of mods. They can
      vary from very curated packs with questing to kitchen sink style packs. The main advantage of doing it this way is
      if its a popular enough pack then there is usually a lot of support for in game issues and bugs. You can get
      modpacks from from the above sources.
    </p>
    <p>
      Making your own modpack is fairly simple if you are willing to do a little leg work. If you just want a few mods
      you could indeed create a new profile on the official launcher and place the mods in the mods folder but I prefer
      to use a program such as Prism. Inside Prism you can add a new instance and choose from a pre-existing modpack,
      import a pack and creating a custom pack. Creating a custom pack will give you the options for the Minecraft
      version and which mod loader you wish to use. After creating your custom pack you can right click it and select
      edit and can drag and drop mods into the mods section.<br>The Modrinth app although still in beta hs much of the
      same functionality although you can only import mods and packs from Modrinth and other launchers, you can also
      make your own custom pack. Making a pack this way has the benefit that any dependencies are also installed. If you
      want optimise your game this would be the better option at least for ease.
    </p>
    <h3>Datapacks</h3>
    <p>
      Datapacks are a lot like mods but use the games already existing functionalities and assets. They have the added
      benefit of only being needed one the server side, meaning if you are making a server for you and your friends this
      can be a way of modding the world and recipes to your liking without the need to install anything on the client
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Datapacks are per world, meaning you can have different ones for different worlds. You can install them to the
      datapack folder inside your world/save folder or by using a program such as Prism or the Modrinth app. They can be
      downloaded from anywhere you can get mods and modpacks.
    </p>
    <h4>Useful Info and Links</h4>
    <h3>The Minecraft Wiki</h3>
    <p>
      This the best source for all things Minecraft, it even contains some very simple tutorials on redstone. If you
      want
      to make your want datapack this is also a good starting point.<br>
      <br><a href="https://minecraft.wiki/">https://minecraft.wiki</a>
    </p>
    <h3>Vanilla Tweaks</h3>
    <p>
      Vanilla tweaks is an excellent source for making a datapack tailored to you. It also has the ability to make a
      resource pack tailored to your wants.<br>

    </p>
    <h3>My Links</h3>
    <p>
      I feel I would be foolish to not include the links to my Modrinth and would like to also add the link for my
      Vanilla
      Optimized pack which can make your game run a lot smoother for less powerful systems or look as beautiful as you
      can
      get it for more beefy systems or of course somewhere in between.<br>
