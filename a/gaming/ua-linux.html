  <h1>Ultimate Apocalypse on Linux</h1>
  So this guide is for the Ultimate Apocalypse mod for Dawn of War Soulstorm but that said I don't see why it wouldn't work for any other mods.<br>
  This is a really simple guide but it should be noted that running UA on linux is not supported by the mod and they will not give support for running the game on linux, that said I am no expert but will help if I can, just use the contact page.<br>
  <h3>Requirements</h3>
  <ul>
  <li><a href="https://lutris.net/">Lutris</a> (only if you want access the mod manager for toggling settings)</li>
  <li><a href="https://usebottles.com/">Bottles</a></li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <h3>Step One</h3>
  Download the mod and any mods it requires, at the time of writing that is only the tyranids mod 0.5b3 and the .52XD patch.
  <h3>Step Two</h3>
  Open Bottles and create a new bottle, it should be an application and you can name it what you want.

  Once made press Run Executable, from here run your installers, I find that its impossible to find the default steam game directory from here as it is hidden, best way around this is make a steam library folder elsewhere, this can be done in steam.<br>
  <br>
  <h3>Step Three</h3>
  Next up is running the mod manager, this is useful for toggling things and checking if your mods are installed correctly but on linux can not be used to launch the game.<br>
  You will want to find the pfx folder for soulstorm it should be here:
  <br><br><code>/SteamLibrary/steamapps/compatdata/9450</code><br><br>
  Copy it to inside your soulstorm directory. Next launch lutris and add a new game by pressing the + on the top left and then add locally installed game.<br>
  
  <ol>
  <li>In Game info name it what you want and select Wine as the runner</li>
  <li>In Game Options under Executable select the mod manager and under wine prefix select the pfx file you moved</li>
  <li>In Runner Options Select the wine version, I used Proton 7 and disable all but esync and fsync</li>
  <li>Hit Save</li>
  </ol>
  <br>
  You should now be able to open the mod manger from in lutris.
  <h3>Step Four</h3>
  Launch the game and in Game manager select The Ultimate Apocalypse.
