          <h2>Awesome Terminal Programs</h2>
          <p>
            Here are some of the awesome terminal programs and utilities I use all the time. I also added two on the end that
            are more just for fun or showing off.
          </p>
          <h3>Nerdfonts</h3>
          <p>
            Okay at the very top of this list is a must have if you plan on using the terminal, they are also cross platform
            so
            once you have one you like you never have to give it up.
            A nerd font is a font with a bunch of added characters and icons that allow for displaying information in a more
            efficient manner. A lot of terminal programs also require a nerd font in order to function correctly.
            Below is a test to make sure your font is set correctly.
          </p>

          <h3>Starship</h3>
          <p>
            Starship is a cross platform shell prompt. Its fast, looks good and is very customisable. Go check it out

          <h3>tldr</h3>
          <p>
            tldr is a terminal help page for humans, the --help and man commands are really hard to read. tldr gives you
            simple
            and useful information in a easy to read format. You should be able to install it using the command you normally
            use.

          <h3>AutoJump</h3>
          <p>
            AutoJump is a neat little time saver that allows you to quickly jump to directories. It works by building up a
            database of
            places you have visited after installing. Simply close and reopen your terminal after it has installed and then cd
            to a location,
            after that you will be able to go back to the locations by using the j command. Example bellow.
            <br>
