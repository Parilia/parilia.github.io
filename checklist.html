<h2>Checklist</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Download <a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher">Balena Etcher</a></li>
        <li>Download the ISO you want from <a href="https://nobaraproject.org/download-nobara/">Here</a></li>
        <li>Do a checksum, if you dont know then look below.</li>
        <li><b>Backup any files you want to keep,</b> it will only install to your choosen drive so your harddrive would keep all its data but long term you will want to format it as linux reading that file system will run into issues. </li>
        <li>Backup your passwords, my advice is take this oppertunity to swap to <a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a> as its free and opensource and runs nicely on linux and android.</li>
        <li>Backup your saves, these can be hard to find, some will be in your documents others will be in appdata folders, remember to check .local, .roaming and locallow. If in doubt search the net for the location.</li>
        <li>Back up all your minecraft stuff, server addresses and any map mod data</li>
        <li>You will need to disable secure boot via your bios, you can do this when in there to tell it to boot your usb drive first. (you will need to chage your boot order back to its default once the OS is installed).</li>
        
    </ul>

    The CertUtil is a pre-installed Windows utility, that can be used to generate hash checksums:
    </br><code>CertUtil -hashfile pathToFileToCheck SHA256</code></p></br>
    So your should look something like this:
    </br><code>CertUtil -hashfile C:\Users\kayla\Desktop\Nobara-37-KDE-2023-04-02.iso SHA256</code>
